### **The User Stories (30)**

#### **Epic 1: The Unified Dashboard & Discovery**

1. **As a Superfan,** I want a unified dashboard so that I can see live results for F1 and MotoGP on the same screen.
2. **As a user,** I want to filter the race calendar by discipline (e.g., Jet Racing only) so I don't see irrelevant events.
3. **As a fan,** I want to "Follow" specific riders/drivers to receive personalized news alerts.
4. **As a user,** I want a "Global Search" to find specific tracks, riders, or engine specs across all sports.
5. **As a mobile user,** I want a simplified "Live View" so I can track race positions while away from my TV.
6. **As a fan,** I want a "Timezone Toggle" so that all race start times are automatically converted to my local time.

#### **Epic 2: Live Telemetry & Real-time Data**

7. **As a Data Nerd,** I want to see live telemetry (speed, gear, throttle) for F1 cars so I can analyze driving styles.
8. **As a Bettor,** I want sub-second latency on race updates so I have the most accurate data for live predictions.
9. **As a Gearhead,** I want to see tire degradation stats during a MotoGP race to understand pit strategies.
10. **As a user,** I want to see a live "Gap to Leader" visualization that updates every second.
11. **As a Jet Racing fan,** I want to track the altitude and G-force of pilots during live air races.
12. **As a technical user,** I want to view historical telemetry logs to compare a rider’s performance across different years.

#### **Epic 3: Engineering & Tech Corner**

13. **As a Gearhead,** I want a "Bike/Car Comparison" tool to see technical specs side-by-side.
14. **As a student,** I want to read "Technical Explainers" on aero-winglets or hybrid engines to learn the science behind the speed.
15. **As a user,** I want to see 3D models of engines with annotated parts for different racing classes.
16. **As a fan,** I want to see "Track Profiles" that highlight technical challenges like elevation changes and braking zones.

#### **Epic 4: Community & Gamification**

17. **As a fan,** I want to join "Paddock Chat" rooms for specific races to discuss the action with others.
18. **As a user,** I want to participate in "Podium Predictions" to earn badges and climb a global leaderboard.
19. **As a fan,** I want to share specific data visualizations (like a lap-time graph) directly to social media.
20. **As a user,** I want to vote on "Driver of the Day" during the final laps of a race.

#### **Epic 5: Backend & Performance (Golang Specific)**

21. **As a Developer,** I want to use **Goroutines** to ingest data from 10+ different racing APIs simultaneously without blocking the main thread.
22. **As a Developer,** I want to implement a **WebSocket server in Go** to push real-time telemetry to thousands of users at once.
23. **As a Developer,** I want to build a **high-speed caching layer** (using Redis) to serve frequently accessed standings in under 10ms.
24. **As a Developer,** I want to implement **gRPC for internal microservices** to ensure fast communication between the news and telemetry modules.
25. **As a Developer,** I want to write **unit tests in Go** for the data-parsing logic to ensure race results are never corrupted during ingestion.
26. **As a Developer,** I want to use **Go's `context` package** to handle API timeouts gracefully during peak race traffic.

#### **Epic 6: Administration & Security**

27. **As an Admin,** I want a CMS dashboard to quickly update race results if an official penalty changes the standings.
28. **As an Admin,** I want to moderate community forums to remove toxic content or spoilers.
29. **As a user,** I want to log in using OAuth (Google/Discord) so I don't have to create another password.
30. **As a security officer,** I want all API endpoints rate-limited to prevent scraping bots from slowing down the site during a race.

### **Nitrous Backend Architecture**

In this architecture, Go's **Concurrency Model** acts like the fuel injectors in a high-performance engine—precisely managing multiple data flows (F1, MotoGP, Jet Racing) to ensure the frontend never "stalls" during high-traffic race weekends.
